Project with spring boot

Installation steps:

- Import maven project from your IDE.
- Build the project from your terminal or IDE, en the terminal type hint *[your-path]~ mvn clean install*.
- Run project as a spring application in your IDE.
- Nice! now you can realize a test with some rest client or from your terminal with curl.
- The endpoint has 3 query params (partial search, latitude and longitude) 
- To test with curl you must type hint *curl http://localhost:8080/suggestions\?q\=Londo\&latitude\=43.70011\&longitude\=-79.4163*

PD: For now the endpoint is not completed, but it's continues working to finish it.
